# Blog Application with Django 4

## Overview

This project is the result of following the first chapter of the book "Django 4 by Examples". In this chapter, we dive into the basics of the Django web framework by creating a simple but functional blog application. This includes designing data models, applying migrations to a database, and developing the application's views, templates, and URLs.

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Django Setup**: Initial configuration and setup of a Django project.
- **Data Models**: Design and creation of Django models for the blog application.
- **Migrations**: Application of migrations to update the database with the defined models.
- **Views**: Development of views to handle the logic of requesting and presenting data.
- **Templates**: Creation of Django templates for rendering the blog content.
- **URLs**: Definition of URL patterns for navigating the blog application.
- Implementing a tagging system by integrating a third-party application
- Generating post recommendations using complex QuerySets
- Creating custom Django template tags and filters
- Creating a sitemap for search engines to crawl your site
- Creating an RSS feed for users to subscribe to your blog
- Building a search engine for your blog using the full-text search engine of PostgreSQL


## Running Tests

To run the tests for your Django project using a specific test database configuration, you can use the following command:

```bash
pytest --ds=mysite.settings_test
```
