# Django 4 By Example - Personal Journey

Welcome to my personal repository for the book "Django 4 By Example" by Antonio Melé. This repository serves as a companion to my journey through the book, documenting the development of real-world applications with Django 4. Unlike a straightforward follow-along, this repository includes my own modifications and enhancements to the book's projects, reflecting a more personalized learning experience.

## Book Overview

"Django 4 By Example" is a comprehensive guide that walks readers through the creation of several applications using Django 4. The book covers real-world scenarios, common problems, and implements best practices with a step-by-step approach.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by chapters, with each chapter corresponding to a specific project or concept discussed in the book. Here's what you can expect:

- **Chapter 1 - Blog Application**: Basics of Django, including models, views, templates, and URLs.
- **Chapter 2 - Social Website**: Diving into more advanced features like authentication, user relationships, and AJAX.
- **Chapter 3 - E-commerce Site**: Building a fully functional online store.
- **...and more**.

Each chapter directory contains its own README file, providing an overview of the chapter's project, key concepts covered, and specific modifications I've made to the original examples.

## Personal Modifications

My modifications include additional features, refactored code for clarity and efficiency, and implementation of newer Django functionalities not covered in the book. These changes aim to enhance the learning experience and showcase how the projects can be adapted and extended.

## Getting Started

To explore these projects, clone the repository and navigate into the chapter you're interested in. Each chapter's README contains detailed setup instructions.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SaiedZ/django-4-by-example.git
